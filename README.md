## About

The Pong Game project is a classic Pong arcade game. It features two paddles and a bouncing ball. The objective is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle while trying to score points by getting the ball past your opponent's paddle.


## How to Play

- Use the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to control the right paddle.
- Use the `W` and `S` keys to control the left paddle.
- The game starts automatically after a brief delay.
- Score points by getting the ball past your opponent's paddle.
- The game ends when the ball hits the side walls, and the score is displayed.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple Python files:

- `main.py`: The main game file that sets up the game, controls user input, and manages the game loop.
- `paddle.py`: Contains the `Paddle` class, which defines the behavior of the paddles.
- `ball.py`: Contains the `Ball` class, which defines the behavior of the ball.
- `scoreboard.py`: Contains the `Scoreboard` class, responsible for tracking and displaying the score.

## Usage

To play the Pong Game:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run `main.py` to start the game.
